<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I appreciate you being here but there's really not much to write about myself as I always prefer to have people get across to me and figure me out. Basically, I just love to write codes and create stuff.</p>

<p>I love jazz, country and soul blues. I enjoy solving mathematics and I dislike busy and crowded spaces; I tend to do better with less distraction. I enjoy swimming, traveling and learning different cultures; I hope I'll be able to go skydiving someday soon</p>

<p>I love making friends; although talking may seem a lot of work some times, I do love to keep it rolling when I can. We could be friends, we could work together, we could learn together, we could be happier together! Do well to reach me via my <a href="./contact.html">Contact Me</a> page and I'll be glad to talk to you. Ciao!</p>
